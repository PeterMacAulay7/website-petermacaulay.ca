# This is the repository for my personal website: <a href = "petermacaulay.ca"> PeterMacAulay.ca </a>
This is place for me to learn web development while simulataneously giving me a place to host my essays, projects, blog posts, or anything I want to share with the world. 

You can learn more about my motivation behind this website on the actual site,
but the short version is that I think a project like building a website gives me an excuse to create things I care about and actually
share them with the world in the way I want to. 


It allows me to have a stronger foundation continued growth; otherwise it feels like building on top of a quick sand tower.
By having my previous work released to the world it solidly cements them in place giving a strong foundation to build that tower on. This way I can feel more connected with
the greater world around me, I now have something to point to, I am no longer incoherently babbling about things that are only in my head. My hope is that others will follow suit
by creating their own websites. I really think it's a valuable exercise that can provide you will something that you may be looking for, even if you don't know it right now.
