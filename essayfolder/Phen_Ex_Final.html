        This is my final paper for my class on phenomenology and existentialism. It was a very
        interesting class. We focused mostly on Merleau-Ponty, but we also dabbled in Fanon, Beauvoir,
        Keirkegaard, and others. This paper is about how I thought Merleau-Ponty to be a good philosophers
        although I didn't find him as satisfying or fitting at Beauvoir or Fanon. I think that I might have
        been judging Merleau-Ponty a little harshly because I was also reading John McDowell and Jan Zwicky in 
        another class at the same time, and there is a lot of overlap; so there was a bit of a competition
        for who made the most sense at the time.

<p>In Phenomenology of Perception, Merleau-Ponty creates a tightly structured account of
human experience that resists traditional dualisms. In his chapter on freedom, he builds a
position not by balancing existentialism and determinism but by critiquing both and going down
a new avenue. For Merleau-Ponty, human action is neither absolutely free nor completely
determined; instead, it emerges from the embodied subject’s ongoing engagement with the
world. His position is compelling and solid; it is rooted in the lived body and the sedimented
history of perception, which relates to most people&#39;s general experience. However, it is precisely
the strength and completeness of Merleau-Ponty’s position that makes me feel unsatisfied. In an
effort to resolve oppositions and clarify the structure of experience, it risks undermining the
ambiguity it claims to respect. Simone de Beauvoir and Frantz Fanon are influenced by
phenomenology but resist this kind of closure. Merleau-Ponty offers a stable structure, to which
they allow for rupture, opacity, and breakdown while respecting ambiguity. These elements are
crucial for understanding the true world. In this paper, I will argue that Merleau-Ponty’s account
of freedom, while rich and insightful, is ultimately limiting to our understanding of human
experience. By comparing his work with Beauvoir and Fanon, I will show how a view more
accepting of ambiguity may be better suited to describe the complexity of real life.</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty begins his account of freedom by discussing total freedom or none at all.
In this section, he discusses how “It is unconceivable that I am free in some of my actions while
determined in others, for what exactly would this idle freedom be that grants free play to
determinisms?” (Merleau-Ponty 459). By this, he is describing that for absolute freedom to
work, there needs to be no doubt that determinism is not playing any role in life. Absolute
freedom is negated when you suggest that any part of life could be determined. If anything is
determined, then you do not have absolute freedom. He describes this by saying, “…there are
only two possibilities: either they have the force to make me act, in which case there is no
freedom, or they do not have this force, in which case my freedom is total…” (Merleau-Ponty
459). Therefore, our actions must be entirely our own or not at all. Thus, Merleau-Ponty suggests
that things like being Jewish, hunchbacked, or handsome are aspects about the individual that are
predetermined and go beyond their choice; how are we free? There is also the divide between the
scientific understanding of causality and our affirmation of absolute freedom. While you can say
that you’re not handsome and are in fact ugly, that doesn’t change how the rest of the world may
see you. While you may have the freedom to believe scientific understanding of causality is
wrong, there are universally agreed upon aspects of the world you cannot control. Take Newton’s
laws for example.</p>
<p>Given the potential problems with absolute freedom, he questions, “Then there is no such
thing as action, choice, or “doing”.” (Merleau-Ponty 461). In this next section, Merleau-Ponty
discusses a deterministic view of the world. Since the actions of the individual cannot be entirely
their own, freedom could be rendered impossible, and we must consider if this is possible or how
it could work. An interesting example of why a deterministic world view might be the case is
because, “…if the slave displays as much freedom by living in fear as he does in breaking his
chains, then it cannot be said that there is such a thing as free action.” (Merleau-Ponty 461).
Here, Merleau-Ponty is displaying that the slave’s actions brought on by living in fear are no
freer than the actions of breaking the chain that held them. This is because what caused the slave
to break the chains was the oppression of being a slave. The slave does not choose to break free
purely on their volition, if they were not oppressed, then there would be no need to break free.
It’s situations like these that counteract a decision changing the future, for it was bound to
happen based on the past. The slave is not changing the future by breaking their chains, only
responding to the oppression. Merleau-Ponty states that “The very notion of freedom requires
that our decision plunge into the future, that something has been done by it…” (Merleau-Ponty
462). Therefore, in the deterministic view, where every decision is presupposed by a cause, there
is no freedom.</p>
<p>Yet Merleau-Ponty does not believe we live in a deterministic world. To find out why, we
first must determine if there is sense in the world. A common pitfall is thinking that you, the
individual is the sinngebung [sense giver], but this can easily fall into idealism or solipsism.
Merleau-Ponty has already determined that both of those world views are not likely or
impossible. This leads him to ask, “Who gives the motives a sense.” (Merleau-Ponty 464). The
answer he gives is simply context. The size of a mountain will only appear large in comparison
to your body when you are at it’s base, while it appears miniscule when viewed far enough away
(Merleau-Ponty 464). Therefore, sense is given to the world by the context around it. No one
individual, deity, object, etc, gives the world sense, but instead, it is how the world interacts with
everything in it that contextually gives sense and meaning. Yet, despite everything in the world
giving context, we still wonder how we can all almost unanimously perceive similar things.
We’ve determined that idealism and solipsism are not viable, and this further proves it. How
could we all or any individual be the sinngebung when everything appears the same or similar to
everyone? In idealism, if the individual is the controller of their perception, then there would be
more inconsistencies between people. In solipsism, we would never be surprised by the world.
Therefore, the world and the individuals in it must all be giving context to each other.</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty then brings in his theory of sedimentation. He believes that the world is
built up upon itself through continued interaction with its interconnected parts. Like a river being
shaped over years from water eroding the edges to form the curves, sequentially, the eroded
sediment fills in other spots. Merleau-Ponty believes that we, as humans, shape the world around
us. While the world was not created by us, just about every aspect has been touched and shaped,
even ever so slightly, by us.</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty has shown that neither absolute freedom nor determinism, or anything in
between, will accurately portray life. Instead, he believes that through our interaction with the
world, we shape it, and it shapes us, but we as individuals choose how we interact with the
world. That is not to say we have complete freedom; the world that we interact with shapes us
and causes us to interact in ways influenced by sedimentation, although there is still freedom. By
choosing this position, Merleau-Ponty feels that he is accurately depicting life and not falling
into the pitfall of dualism between the two extremes. The position depicts a mosaic of gears
meshing into each other, subtly shaving off parts with too little tolerance, and those shavings are
collected and used in solidifying the mosaic.</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty does a good job at painting a picture of reality that most people can look
at and think that he has captured the view of how our freedom works in a material world with
unique minds. Despite this, I’m unsatisfied. I cannot help but feel that Merleau-Ponty has
brought us a beautiful, all-encompassing tapestry of life that you have no choice but to bow
down to. It’s impressive; it solves a lot of problems that people have had with the world for a
long time, but to me, it doesn’t capture life, experience, and meaning. It paints a picture of how
everything works together, but not only does it fail to account for everyone, but it is negating the
ambiguity of the world. Even if Merleau-Ponty’s account of freedom is accepting of potential
ambiguity, the notion of his theory accounting for all scenarios suggests that there is no
ambiguity. Merleau-Ponty suggests that the world is ambiguous in his refutation of idealism and
solipsism such that we as the individual cannot know all. “A consistent transcendental idealism
strips the world of its opacity and its transcendence.” (Merleau-Ponty LXXV). A trivial case of
this is not knowing the colour of the back of a chair because you haven’t perceived it yet.
What is the human experience if the world, and particularly freedom, is not ambiguous?
Does that suggest that there is potential for a greater purpose? An absolute way to live? If you
cannot fit into Merleau-Ponty’s handcrafted mosaic, are you not supposed to be here? All these
questions arise when you try to pin down the world into a model of itself. Sure, models are
helpful. They help us see patterns and connections that are hard to see up close in the weeds. But
models are not true to life. Models exclude and simplify. To suggest that we could find the limits
of freedom is to suggest an unambiguous world. Just as any scientific theory cannot fully capture
the world, neither can a phenomenological one. What sets some other theories apart from a
Merleau-Ponty-like theory is that they see the experience of being a human, and they only show
how the world reflects this, but they do not suggest that the world or freedom is holistically any
which way. This is not to say that absolute freedom is the way, as Merleau-Ponty showed that it
isn’t always the case. Instead, I’m only suggesting that the way Merleau-Ponty is presenting his
position sets him up to pin freedom down, rejecting others’ experiences and ambiguity.</p>
<p>To point out what I’m saying here, I’d like to go over how Beauvoir presents not only a
different experience and perception of freedom from Merleau-Ponty, but she also doesn’t fall into
pinning freedom down. Beauvoir acknowledges the ambiguity of the world, and instead of
treating it like a problem to solve as Merleau-Ponty does, she treats it as a fundamental part of
ethically living. “To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision.”
(Beauvoir 24). Beauvoir never tries to structure and solve the ambiguous world. She shows how
you must truly accept the ambiguity. Once you realize that it is the only thing you can truly
know, you can begin to learn how to live ethically. Only then can we take responsibility for our
freedom. “Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the
original condition of all justification of existence.” (Beauvoir 24). You need to take
responsibility for your freedom, and only then will you be free. Taking responsibility in an
ambiguous world is when meaning is born. This is a wildly different account than Merleau-
Ponty&#39;s. I find this account satisfying not because Beauvoir’s theory is less provable or
something along those lines but because it accepts our condition. Beauvoir is not making
assumptions she can’t be sure of, and still, it appears to mirror life as Merleau-Ponty’s did. The
difference is that Beauvoir’s mirroring of life isn’t about making it all fit. This is why Beauvoir’s
account feels like a mirror, whereas Merleau-Ponty’s feels like a zoomed-out tapestry or a
crowded family tree. Just as the mountains appear small from Sirius, the lives of humans do in an
all-encompassing tapestry.
In Beauvoir’s worldview, Merleau-Ponty can still be useful and provide valuable insight,
but it doesn’t account for everything as it tries to do, and in doing that, it attempts to do what
cannot be done. Knowing everything cannot be done. Frantz Fanon furthers this point by
showing that sedimentation does not occur as Merleau-Ponty suggests. Instead of slow, subtle
sedimentation, Fanon describes a hostile, violent sedimentation. The harmonious vision that
Merleau-Ponty describes, envisioning sedimentation as a give-and-take situation, is simply not
true for Fanon. “In the white world, the man of color encounters difficulties in elaborating his
body schema.” (Fanon 90). Colonialization, racism, and generally the views of others upon the
self disproportionately sediment the individual. Their freedom is still their own, but the sediment
of the world is impacting that freedom. If sedimentation shapes your freedom, then how could
someone like Fanon ever live their life? In Merleau-Ponty’s version of freedom, Fanon must
always try to wear a white mask to hide his black skin. Fanon shows how being rational,
irrational, isolated, and integrated in society can’t make a dent in the mountain of sediment that
suppresses his freedom. Despite this, Fanon is not trapped under the mountain. After a horrifying
experience on the bus, Fanon is ripped from his body-schema, his self was in thirds. When his
body-schema was returned to him, “My body was returned to me spread-eagled, disjointed,
redone, draped in mourning on this white winter&#39;s day.” (Fanon 93). The repair he is constantly
having to do to his body schema is exhausting and can inhibit freedom, but Fanon still has
freedom. How could Fanon still have freedom in Merleau-Ponty’s view? Surely, the mountain of
sediment would have been too much, yet Fanon is not stuck. “I embrace the world! I am the
world!” (Fanon 107). Fanon has taken responsibility for realizing his self, giving him freedom
from oppressive structures. Yes, the sediment is debilitating, but he is still able to see the
ambiguity of the world, allowing him to be free despite others&#39; perspectives.</p>
<p>Merleu-Ponty says “we are condemned to sense , and there is nothing we can do or say
that does not acquire a name in history.” (Merleau-Ponty LXXXiV). This further suggests that
he does acknowledge some ambiguity in freedom but ultimately looks for meaning where it isn’t.
Meaning is not gained through history. History provides a useful context to us as humans, but it
doesn’t state anything about the world except what happened. There are names for things in
history, but names, while useful, aren’t meaningful. Meaning, as Beauvoir suggests, comes from
living in and understanding ambiguity. “if freedom were a thing or a quality naturally attached
to a thing. Then, in effect, one would either have it or not have it. But the fact is that it merges
with the very movement of this ambiguous reality which is called existence and which is only by
making itself be; to such an extent that it is precisely only by having to be conquered that it gives
itself.” (Beauvoir 25). The meaning that Beauvoir describes might not be the same meaning
Merleau-Ponty describes. It seems as though Merleau-Ponty is describing a meaning that holds
everything together: why we do the things we do. This meaning for him sprouts from ambiguity
and is built on top of it. Beauvoir is describing a meaning in the facticity and inescapability of
ambiguity. Beauvoir suggests that meaning comes from accepting and wrestling with ambiguity
in good faith. Merleau-Ponty shows his understanding that there is ambiguity, but still suggests
there is a greater meaning, a meaning tied to how the world has interacted with each other.</p>
<p>Fanon, like Beauvoir, accepts the ambiguity of the world, but Fanon emphasizes that
ambiguity can be obscured. “The white gaze, the only valid one, is already dissecting me. I am
fixed.” (Fanon 95). Here, Fanon shows that the ambiguity of the world is not equally available.
The racialized gaze reifies him, turning him into an object, stripping the ambiguity of his
selfhood away. Fanon, as discussed earlier, does not abandon freedom. He is just suggesting that
the weight of the white gaze insists he not be. Still, his very ability to reflect on this situation
shows that he is free. It is not freedom arising from neutral ambiguity but from the tension
between objectification and lived self-awareness. This conflicts with Merleau-Ponty’s notions of
meaning harmoniously arising from ambiguity. Ambiguity is not the seed of freedom. The world
violently denies ambiguity for Fanon. He needs to fight to reclaim ambiguity, which is what
creates freedom.</p>
<p>Fanon resists any attempt to render the world as fully intelligible or ordered. he shows
how racialized individuals are not simply co-constituting meaning through free interaction with
the world, but are instead interpellated into roles they did not choose. When Fanon is called a
slur on the bus, it captures the violence of being named, seen, and fixed in place by another’s
gaze (Fanon 89). This kind of rupture is not a moment of ambiguous freedom but of existential
shattering, an encounter that cannot be integrated into Merleau-Ponty’s harmonious, sedimented
mosaic of perception. For Fanon, the body is not always a site of pre-reflective meaning-making
but can instead become an object of surveillance and control, stripped of its capacity to act freely.
His account of embodied life foregrounds the breakdowns in shared meaning, the moments
where sedimentation fails and violence rushes in. In this sense, Fanon offers an indispensable
reminder: Freedom cannot be understood solely as a process of self-shaping within a world that
already makes sense. Sometimes, that world must be ruptured for freedom to emerge at all.</p>
<p>Is Merleau-Ponty useful or harmful? Ultimately, I think Merleau-Ponty has provided a lot
of useful philosophy, but specifically, the way he describes the world so analytically cannot
cover everything. There is more to the world than he describes, and I think he knows that, but the
way Beauvoir describes freedom is just way too useful to me. I suppose it depends on what you
want to get out of it. In phenomenology, where it’s your job to describe the world, Merleau-
Ponty did a pretty good job. As a reader, wanting clarity for the world I live in, I prefer Beauvoir
and Fanon. Which is why they aren’t doing phenomenology. The experience I had reading
Beauvoir and Fanon was real, whereas Merleau-Ponty felt like a Wikipedia entry. That’s not
inherently a bad thing; I’ve been down many a Wikipedia rabbit hole and am grateful for it.
When discussing what it means to perceive, live and be a human, I might turn to Wikipedia for
some answers but not for relating to others. Fanon does a great job showing this with his fluid
writing and use of poetry. Poetry is an amazing way to get extremely close to conveying human
experience. Still, poetry falls short, phenomenology falls short, and science falls short. Merleau-
Ponty does do a great job using metaphors which transport your mind to similar scenarios. Yet,
each of the individual methods of conveying human experience falls short in some way and is
better in others. The problem is that Merleau-Ponty tried to use these methods to put piecewise
parts together. Beauvoir and Fanon did not attempt to put the parts together. They used some of
the methods Merleau-Ponty did, but they weren’t building a structure, instead, they called it as
they saw it. Beauvoir and Fanon wrote about what they knew and didn’t try to dissect it into
parts of a whole, they gave us the whole. As mentioned, they aren’t exactly trying to compete,
but still, when put against each other, there is a clear winner in my eyes. That being said, the
individual parts of Merleau-Ponty are fascinating and, I think, do a better job at getting closer to
being satisfying. This is because those parts are only describing life, not trying to make it
comprehensive. That’s what I think phenomenology should do: describe perception but not try to
solve life.</p>
