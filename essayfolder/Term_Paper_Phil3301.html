        An essay I wrote in december of 2024 for my analytic philosophy-in origin class. This class preceeded my analytic philosophy-in progress class, which was a continuation of this class and can be seen in my John McDowell, and Jan Zwicky papers.
        This essay was me trying to weave together a through line with honestly too many philosophers for one paper.
        In this essay I cover early and late Wittgenstein, Richard Rorty, Iris Murdoch, and Lorraine Code. At the time, this was my
        most comphrehensive essay, and I think it was an important step in my philosophy writing progress.
        This class sort of taught me what writing philosophy is all about. I didn't come out a master, but
        after going back to some earlier essays I wrote at the start of this class, they don't compare.

<center>Term Paper</center>
<p>Early Ludwig Wittgenstein’s work in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, shows the
logical structure of reality and how language mirrors it through propositions. Wittgenstein also
attempts to show the readers the limits of language. Similarly, Iris Murdoch demonstrates how
using metaphors grounded in human experience can greatly improve understanding of theoretical
constructs. In Wittgenstein’s later Philosophical Investigations, he shifts his focus toward
practical use and shared understanding of language. Richard Rorty’s pragmatic views share
similarities with later Wittgenstein in showing us, the importance of context and utility in truth.
In our world today, understanding is not only useful for philosophy, but it is also a vital step
toward bridging human divides. Lorainne Code furthers Rorty’s views but questions what we can
know and the responsibilities of knowing. She further shows that action in seeking knowing is
crucial. Through understanding, we can determine our values, and then we can then act upon
them. Understanding context is what can connect humans and progress society.
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, is a peculiar and deeply methodical
philosophical work. Early in the text, it becomes clear that young Ludwig Wittgenstein is
attempting to construct a precise framework that defines the world and the relationship between
everything in it, and even what lies beyond it. He begins the book by saying, “The world is</p>
<p>everything that is the case” (Wittgenstein, 1, p57). From this foundation, Wittgenstein
systematically defines his structure of the world. He proposes that the world is made up of facts
rather than mere objects, for an object is unthinkable but facts can be thought and said through
language and logical propositions. Wittgenstein&#39;s “picture theory of meaning,” suggests that
propositions function as pictures, mirroring the logical structure they describe. Wittgenstein
determines that language can describe the facts of the world through propositions, while logic
shapes and structures what can be said. Wittgenstein says that everything beyond the world, such
as philosophy, ethics, or the mystical cannot be described by language because they are topics
that deal with what lies beyond the factual realm. Philosophical problems arise when we attempt
to say what can only be shown.</p>
<p>In the second to last proposition of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein says, “My propositions
are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as nonsense, when he
has climbed out though them, on them, over them (He must so to speak throw away the ladder,
after he has climbed up on it)* He must overcome these propositions; then he sees the world
rightly*”(Wittgenstein, 6.54, p117). I believe that by saying that his propositions are nonsense,
Wittgenstein is saying that his propositions attempt to describe beyond the world which he
established is not possible for language. In the metaphor of the ladder, Wittgenstein is suggesting
that the propositions aid in beginning to understand philosophical problems, but they cannot
describe what is not of the world.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein tells the reader how the Tractatus will end in the preface by saying, “This
book will perhaps only be understood by those who have themselves already thought the thoughts
which are expressed in it —or have thought similar thoughts.” (Wittgenstein, Preface, p55). This
passage tells the reader from the very beginning that the propositions are only useful to a point
but after that, you will need something more akin to proposition 6.54. The ladder metaphor in
proposition 6.54, appears very clear to the reader that Wittgenstein is saying the propositions can
only take you this far, and you must use another way to adequately deal with philosophical
problems. I believe in using a metaphor to tell this to the reader, he is suggesting that metaphors
being grounded in human experience is what allows them to be more useful to understanding for
the reader. A metaphor is a way to show philosophy because language is not conducive to
describing what isn’t in the world, but the human mind is good at relating concepts to experience.
Iris Murdoch speaks about the use of metaphors in her paper, ‘The Sovereignty of Good’.
Murdoch says, “Metaphors are not merely peripheral decorations or even useful models, they
are fundamental forms of our awareness of our condition: metaphors of space, metaphors of
movement, metaphors of vision.” (Murdoch, p75). This quote shows how Murdoch views
metaphors in a way that is not merely a tool in language but a way to view the human experience.
A metaphor is a way to show a concept by reminding the reader how they might’ve felt in a
given experience. A proposition may be able to describe the facts of the world as Wittgenstein
showed. Wittgenstein also showed that those propositions are often very hard to grasp and
understand. Metaphors as Murdoch describes, are very connected to how we think as humans.
Metaphors communicate concepts in the same way that we think, this should help the receiver of
the information be much more apt to understand it. Although we live in a world that is best
described by propositions, we can acknowledge that as humans, we have learned to communicate
differently based on our needs. While a proposition can deliver truth, the absolute truth is not
always known.</p>
<p>Murdoch later in her paper describes unselfing. The process of unselfing requires the
individual to let go of their personal biases, conflicts, and ego, to just reflect on the world. What
is truly happening? She describes the need for unselfing by saying, ” We are anxiety-ridden
animals. Our minds are continually active, fabricating an anxious, usually self-preoccupied,
often falsifying veil which partially conceals the world. Our states of consciousness differ in
quality, our fantasies and reveries are not trivial and unimportant, they are profoundly connected
with our energies and our ability to choose and act.”(Murdoch, p82). The process is therapeutic
to help the individual see what matters beyond their ego. Using metaphors Murdoch hopes to
create a world in which concepts are easily digestible by describing them with shared
experiences. Through frequent unselfing, she hopes to rid decisions of personal biases and
remind people of what matters. This is a glimpse of pragmatic thought in that Murdoch does not
want individuals to be bogged down by aspects that ultimately have no relevance in the situation.
Murdoch is just offering it in a way to help the individual live morally and healthily. The overlap
between Murdoch’s unselfing, and the thoughts of Richard Rorty, Lorainne Code, and even
Wittgenstein is very interesting. While differing in their approaches, they are all working toward
a common goal of understanding using relevant context.</p>
<p>In Wittgenstein’s next and only other published work, the Philosophical Investigations, he
doesn’t quite pick up where he left but he does continue the work from the Tractatus with a new
focus. This is why I believe he wanted the two works to be published together. The work in the
Tractatus is so closely tied to the Philosophical Investigations as Wittgenstein guides you through
everything to do with language. In the investigations, Wittgenstein pivots his point of
determining the logical structure of reality and how language mirrors it through propositions and
instead, he focuses on the use of language, ”The meaning of a word is its use in the language.”
(Wittgenstein, §§43). When attempting to elevate a concept to find its meaning, you find that it
can’t be done without using another definition. Wittgenstein gives the example of defining what
a ‘game’ is to prove this point. He attempts to define what a ‘game’ is although every definition
seems to lack the full expansion of what the word ‘game’ can mean. Thus, by attempting to put a
definition on the word ‘game’ you are excluding aspects of the word. Yet we still know what
people mean by the word ‘game’ and even more so when they put it in the context of what type
of game they are referring to. Wittgenstein’s solution is to understand language through context.
(Wittgenstein, §§66-77). A problem with language is that everyone can experience things
differently. The solution is to acknowledge this fact and use human rationality to come to an
understanding. Wittgenstein had a concept he called, a private language, in which a person’s
experiences and perceptions result in a different private language for them, that is potentially
incomprehensible to others. So how do we communicate if everyone has their own understanding
that can vastly skew meaning between people? Rooting meaning in what you can agree on is how
we generally are able to overcome the issue of different understanding. You can use what you
both agree on and work from there. You could say that people could have such different
perceptions to the point that agreeing doesn’t even mean the same thing or emotions work
differently between the two people causing more confusion. This can happen but practically
speaking these differences, while sometimes being hard obstacles to overcome, are just that,
obstacles that can be overcome. Using language in this practical way we can more effectively
communicate.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein introduces what he calls language games into the investigations. A language
game is a simplified model of the world to understand better how we can understand and use
language. Through language games, Wittgenstein was able to show how context is one of the
most important aspects of language. A prominent example is that of the builders, A &amp; B, who
need to communicate to build a building despite not having a shared language, “B has to pass the
stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language
consisting of the words &quot;block&quot;, &quot;pillar&quot;, &quot;slab&quot;, &quot;beam&quot;. A calls them out;—B brings the stone
which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.——Conceive this as a complete primitive
language.”(Wittgenstein, §§2). Wittgenstein uses this example to show that through human
reasoning, two builders who needed to communicate were able to do so using context. The
example shows how it is not important for either builder to know more about the word other than
it corresponds to a specific type of object. Despite there potentially being more than one block, or
slab, the builders could understand that the name given was in reference to the type. This
understanding is how humans learn to create language and use it. Language is for use and while
definitions can help, they are only for context. A definition cannot be made without reference to
something else, thus the definition can only be there to give context to your prior knowledge and
experiences.</p>
<p>Richard Rorty, in his paper, ‘Pragmatism, Relativism, and Irrationalism’ champions the
pragmatic view in showing that truth is adherent to context. Rorty shows us how truth is a tool
that can be used to aid in understanding. We cannot know absolute truths because all concepts
only have meaning in context. Wittgenstein showed this in the investigations with his critique of
elevating concepts. Things are always changing in the world, even if we don’t know it. Why
should we hold our truths to the standard of never changing; when the context changes, the utility
of that truth is no longer relevant. Absolute truths are not something we can count on in the
world, in regards to what the pragmatist wants, Rorty says, “He wants us to give up the notion
that God, or evolution, or some other under-writer of our present world-picture, has
programmed us as machines for accurate verbal picturing, and that philosophy brings
selfknowledge by letting us read our own program”(Rorty, p726). In taking a pragmatic
approach, you must do it with full intention of doing so. Rorty speaks on this by addressing the
claims of him being a relativist and an irrationalist. To the claim of being a relativist, Rorty says
that the definition of believing anything is not the ideology that he claims to be. Instead, he says
that there are no truths or frameworks that are correct across all contexts. To address the claim of
being an irrationalist, which would mean he rejects reason is also not what he believes. Rorty
says that reason is crucial to developing contextual truths. To develop a truth, Rorty believes that
you must use reason to determine the context of the situation you’re in, and from there you can
determine a useful truth. A common critique of pragmatism is that it can be dangerous, but those
claims are built on confusion of pragmatism with relativism, and irrationalism.</p>
<p>Rorty’s pragmatism is deeply entwined with the path that Wittgenstein has been going
down throughout his philosophical career. Wittgenstein has been showing throughout his works
that understanding each other is of utmost importance. More so in the investigations,
Wittgenstein shows that context is key to that understanding. While Wittgenstein’s focus
specifically on language is fascinating and deeply useful, Rorty’s pragmatism offers a wider
approach with overall more utility. Rorty shows how language is for utility in determining truths,
but he also shows the value of anti-foundationalism. As mentioned above in Rorty’s critique of
relativism, he thinks that there is no truth or framework that can be true across all contexts and
that is a key aspect to understanding our place in the world. By acknowledging this fact, you can
begin to work with what you know. Rorty says, “The pragmatist, however, must remain
ethnocentric and offer examples. He can only say: &quot;undistorted&quot; means employing our criteria of
relevance, where we are the people who have read and pondered Plato, Newton, Kant, Marx,
Darwin, Freud, Dewey, etc.” (Rorty, p736). Rorty’s Ethnocentrism is knowing what we know,
because of where we are and the life we’ve lived. Rorty uses this concept because while he
acknowledges that there are no absolute truths, you can use what has seemed to work throughout
history given contexts. While Rorty says that ethnocentrism is useful in figuring out what you
believe, you must also be open to new ideas and cultures. Rorty mainly uses ethnocentrism to
advocate for Western liberal democratic values. He does this not because he believes that they are
the only right values, instead he sees that they have worked throughout history, to foster
inclusivity, reduce cruelty, and protect the freedoms of individuals. This is why Rorty believes
that absolute truths for the sake of progress are nonsensical and useless. Rorty says, “The
pragmatists tell us, what matters is our loyalty to other human beings clinging together against
the dark, not our hope of getting things right.” (Rorty, p727) in this statement Rorty encapsulates
what the goal of the pragmatist is, not to find truth but to aid humans. Having beliefs based on
what is important and useful to us as humans, is allowing us to choose what we want to value.
Rorty believes that we should all be ironic liberals. By this, he means that we should hold liberal
values, but not rely on them or think that they can never lead us astray. Instead, Rorty urges us to
question and evaluate our values, and knowledge based on context to garner a better
understanding.</p>
<p>Lorraine Code in her paper, ‘What Can She Know’, goes over how knowledge is a social
construct, and we need to reflect on what we can really know. The idea of a universal detached
knower is impossible. This is because so many aspects affect a person and what they can know.
For example, a person’s experience, identity, and place in the world, both physically, and
structurally affect your ability to know. Code critiques the idea of objective knowledge entirely in
saying that it leads to the dismissal of other views. This is like what we saw with Rorty in
rejecting absolute truths because they can lead to a less useful answer given the context. Code
takes a slightly different approach in describing her mitigated critical relativism, “to resist
reductionism and to accommodate divergent perspectives”(Code, p320) she says this to highlight
how many perspectives there are in the world, and so many of them are marginalized groups such
as women who are overlooked and never considered. Thus, Code implores knowers to take
epistemic responsibility. Such a responsibility states that a knower must always attempt to see
what is beyond their own biases. As stated, Code believes knowing is social, and as such you
must attempt to truly encompass as many views as you can to get the clearest answer. Knowledge
after all is gained through social interaction as we do not have a use for knowledge beyond it. If
you were to have someone who knew nothing, then they would not need to know, they only
would need to feel and react. Knowing is a responsibility for living socially. To not take
epistemic responsibility is to deny the existence of other groups in society and deny potential
truth.
While Rorty takes a passive position of suggesting we should be ironic liberals. So, to say
that we should hold liberal values but be aware of pitfalls and be open to other ideologies is
passive and leads to solidity in values but suggests no action. Code’s epistemic responsibility
encourages knowers to seek out other views. Code is open to many different divergent
perspectives but uses situational context to determine where we should search for answers. Code
rejects forcing an answer by holding a belief so tightly that you are ignoring context and utility.
Instead, by using situational awareness and previous knowledge, you can determine whether
certain values are worth holding for the situation you’re in. This sounds very similar to Rorty but
ultimately Code does not wish to push an ideology for it cannot be true in all situations. Although
it may seem as though we have no knowledge now to help in determining future knowledge; we
still have experiences and thoughts to rely on, but we just always have to address contextual
aspects in determining answers. Prior thoughts and experiences are still there important, but the
individual must always seek more perspectives and use that experience in the context of your
situation.
From early Wittgenstein, to Murdoch, to later Wittgenstein, to Rorty, to Code, all these
philosophers have been about understanding something. As we went on it became more focused
and clearer that understanding is key. Understanding requires context for a useful understanding,
and it often requires various methods of aiding people to grasp that understanding. I believe that
understanding is one of the most important parts of human society. Humans are always so
divided based on differences in culture, education, and perceptions. Understanding each other is
only the first step to closing rifts between people but it doesn’t end there. While understanding is
a large first step in aiding humans, once that understanding is there, action needs to be taken.
Action to not only ensure your understanding is useful but to do something now that we’re
aligned. For philosophy, I see understanding as the goal and context as a means toward it. The
question of what philosophy is has come up a lot over the term, and I think that the lack of
definition is not surprising given the content of this course. A concept, even one so fundamental
as philosophy which originates in ‘to think’, cannot be tied down to a single definition. In
essence though, I think philosophy is to help humans. In saying that I don’t intend to have given
any definition, but I think philosophy will continue to change as it has throughout history, but
people will continue to try and figure out what is going on to aid progress. Ultimately, I think
what philosophy comes down to is the context of the time, place, person, and many other factors.
While philosophy can give us so much in understanding, the action is up to the people once
they’ve united.</p>
