                        An essay I wrote in March 2025 about Jan Zwicky's book 'The Experience of Meaning'.
                        This was for my analytic philosophy class, and the topic was about the ethical part of the book.
                        'The Experience of meaning' is potentially my favourite book. Similar to my McDowell essay,
                        I remember being happy with this at the time but I spent most of the summer thinking about both
                        'The Experience of Meaning' and 'Mind and World' and I have many things I might say if I were to rewrite it.
                        Also similarly to the McDowell essay, it allowed me to distill a lot of thoughts that I had been wrestling with, and 
                        those thoughts needed to be organized so that I could move onto the newer thoughts.

            <h2><a href="imports/McDowell_Paper.html">McDowell Essay- John McDowell and the Cure for Philosophical Vertigo </a></h2><br>
            <a href="imports/McDowell_Paper.html"><div class = "contentbox">

                    <li>
                        An essay I wrote in Febuary 2025 about John McDowell's book 'Mind and World'.
                        This was for my analytic philosophy class, and I believe the topic was specifically
                        about the intollerable oscillation. I now have a million other thoughts on this book
                        since writing the essay, but I remember being happy with this at the time. It allowed
                        me to distill a lot of thoughts that I had been wrestling with. Those thoughts needed
                        to be organized so that I could move onto the newer thoughts I wanted to think about.

            <a href="imports/Peter_MacAulay_PHIL_3301_Term_Paper1.html"><div class = "contentbox">

                        An essay I wrote in december of 2024 for my analytic philosophy-in origin class. This class preceeded my analytic philosophy-in progress class, which was a continuation of this class and can be seen in my John McDowell, and Jan Zwicky papers.
                        This essay was me trying to weave together a through line with honestly too many philosophers for one paper.
                        In this essay I cover early and late Wittgenstein, Richard Rorty, Iris Murdoch, and Lorraine Code. At the time, this was my
                        most comphrehensive essay, and I think it was an important step in my philosophy writing progress.
                        This class sort of taught me what writing philosophy is all about. I didn't come out a master, but
                        after going back to some earlier essays I wrote at the start of this class, they don't compare.
