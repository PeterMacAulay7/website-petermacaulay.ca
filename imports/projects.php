                Venture through your dreams while narrowly avoiding nightmares! 
                Gain winks to get first place. Use special tiles to gain an advantage. 
                Whatever you do, watch out for the nightmare!

                    This is a game I made with a group project in our object oriented class. This game was meant to
                    use object oriented principles to recreate a board game in a digital format.

                <li>Barbie vs Zombie is a small game I also made in my object oriented design class.</li>
                <br>
                <li>It's a terminal game that displays a grid in which you play as Barbie. Also in the grid
                    are zombies and food. The zombies will track and chase Barbie, while Barbie must collect
                    all the food to keep up her health and end the game. If too many zombies hit Barbie, game over.
