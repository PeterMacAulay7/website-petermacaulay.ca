                    This is a document search and management tool that was created in a team consisting of myself, Abdullah Elashy, and Faycal Kilali as a final project for our Software Design class.

                    The Document Search & Management Tool is designed to provide a usability-friendly document storage and retrieval system. 
                    Unlike simple file systems, this tool abstracts the storage layer, allowing users to interact with a database through a clean command-line interface. 
                    Users can upload files from their local machine, search for them by file name or file content, and perform actions like downloading or removing them.

                Venture through your dreams while narrowly avoiding nightmares! 
                Gain winks to get first place. Use special tiles to gain an advantage. 
                Whatever you do, watch out for the nightmare!

                    This is a game I made with a group project in our object oriented class. This game was meant to
                    use object oriented principles to recreate a board game in a digital format.

                <li>Barbie vs Zombie is a small game I also made in my object oriented design class.</li>
                <br>
                <li>It's a terminal game that displays a grid in which you play as Barbie. Also in the grid
                    are zombies and food. The zombies will track and chase Barbie, while Barbie must collect
                    all the food to keep up her health and end the game. If too many zombies hit Barbie, game over.
