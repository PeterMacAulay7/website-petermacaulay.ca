                Happy Anniversary Nadia! Welcome to our website!
            </p>
            <h3> I love you so much! </h3>
            <p>
                I just want to say thank you for being an amazing girlfriend over the past three years. You've made my life so much better
                in ways that I can't even describe. Every step of the way throughout such a tremultuous period of our lives, you've been
                there to help me through it. Many people consider maintaining a strong relationship to be a challenge, but you made it so easy
                to Love you. I'm so lucky to have you in my life. &#9829;<br>
                Who knows what the future holds for us beyond university, but I'm excited regardless, because I'll have you with me.<br>
                Even when it's stressful, and we don't know what we're doing, I know that my relationship with you will make me happy.<br>
                I hope that I can make you as happy as you make me. &#9829;
            </p>
            <p>
                Below I've posted a collage of some of my favourite pictures of us together.<br> 
                Together we can design and update this website!
                Maybe we can keep it as an anniversary tradition, or we could just make it a homepage for our relationship.
                No matter what I'd be very excited to be able to make something with you! &#9829;<br>
                As you can tell, this site needs some design work. lol. Good thing I know the best around!
