            <li>Just posted a blog post that I'm actually pretty happy with for a quick little post.
              I&#39ve found that these things really help me know what I&#39m thinking about, so that irl
              I have somehting to back up my thoughts, and I think it will long term help to practice writing</li>
            <li>I have an essay and a project coming soon. They are both school assignments so I will likely add them mid December after exams</li>
            <li>Added functionality for displaying content in Blog, Essays, and Projects.
              I also created fun little images for a couple of projects and an essay.
            Additionally I wrote a function that can scrap the most recent of each page to display on the home page. -Nov/04/25</li>

            <li>I have big plans for taking the dev side of this website to a new level;
              you may not see all of it as a visitor, I will have a blog post or project update when I'm done.
              Mostly because those are the types of pages that will be possible with my plans.
