            <li>I just posted my latest project that I was working on in the fall semester. It's a group project that was created as a term project in my Software Design class</li><br>
            <li>Just posted a blog post that I'm actually pretty happy with for a quick little post. I&#39ve found that these things really help me know what I&#39m thinking about, so that irl I have something to back up my thoughts, and I think it will long term help to practice writing</li><br>
            <li>I have an essay and a project coming soon. They are both school assignments so I will likely add them mid December after exams</li><br>
            <li>Added functionality for displaying content in Blog, Essays, and Projects. I also created fun little images for a couple of projects and an essay. Additionally I wrote a function that can scrap the most recent of each page to display on the home page. -Nov/04/25</li>
            <br>
            <li>Just updated the page to use the index.php file as a directory for all other pages. 
              It took a lot longer than expected. &#40I guess thats to be expected&#41 -Nov/03/25</li>
            <br>
            <li>Added a 404 page with amusing photos -Nov/03/25</li>

            <li>Currently learning HTML/CSS/PHP</li>
            <br>
            <li>I have big plans for taking the dev side of this website to a new level;
              you may not see all of it as a visitor, I will have a blog post or project update when I'm done.
              Mostly because those are the types of pages that will be possible with my plans.
